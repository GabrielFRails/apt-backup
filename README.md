# script_bash

This repository was made to keep GabrielFRails personal bash scripts. Since he accidentally destroyed his SSD and all installed O.Ss, he felt the need to create some scripts to easily reinstall his repositories, this is a beginning and all contributions are welcome.

## Attention!

Before using the scripts, remember that the "**basic.sh**" file contains the commands to install Google Chrome and git/git configs into your Linux system. You will need **edit** this file to config your **personal git data** (user and e-mail).

## Executing the scripts

Open the terminal in the cloned repository folder and execute these commands:

```
$ chmod +x runall.sh
$ ./runall.sh
```

## Notes

If you want to, you can execute each script separately:

```
$ cd ./scripts
$ chmod +x script_name.sh
$ ./script_name.sh
```

Also, the logs will be saved in the `logs` folder. Thanks and enjoy!
