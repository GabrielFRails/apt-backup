# script_bash
This repostiry was made to keep GabrielFRails personal bash scripts, since he accidentally destroy his sdd and all S.O's installed, he felt the need to create some scripts to easily reinstall his repositories, this is a begginig and all contributions are wellcome.

## Attention!
Before use the scripts, remember that in the **"basic.sh"** file are the commands to install Google Chrome and git/git configs into your linux system, you will need **edit** this file to config yout **personal git data** (user and e-mail).   


## Execution:
Open the terminal in the clonned folder and do this commands:
> - $ chmod +x runall.sh
> - $ ./runall.sh

## Notes:
If you want to, you can execute each script separately:
> - $ cd ./scripts
> - $ chmod +x script_name.sh
> - $ ./script_name.sh

Also, the logs will be saved in the logs folder, thanks and enjoy!
