# A brief history

This repository was made to keep my personal backup scripts. Since he accidentally destroyed his SSD and all installed O.S's, i felt the need to create some scripts to easily reinstall my stuff (basic env for development), this is a beginning and all contributions are welcome.

## Executing the script

Open the terminal in the cloned repository folder and execute these commands:

```
% make backup.sh
```
